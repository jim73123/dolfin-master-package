Description: Shared links and header files for DOLFIN
 DOLFIN is the Python and C++ interface of the FEniCS project for the
 automated solution of differential equations, providing a consistent
 PSE (Problem Solving Environment) for solving ordinary and partial
 differential equations. Key features include a simple, consistent and
 intuitive object-oriented API; automatic and efficient evaluation of
 variational forms; automatic and efficient assembly of linear
 systems; and support for general families of finite elements.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
